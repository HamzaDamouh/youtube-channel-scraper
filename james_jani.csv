2,The Dark World of Megachurches,0:32:16,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTfKpAWkgJY,2022-02-27,"Megachurches, Televangelists, and the Prosperity Gospel... those were things that I had never heard of before... until I stumbled across an infamous interview with Kenneth Copeland by Lisa Guerrero  from Inside Edition.

What ensued after was a dive into rabbit hole unlike any other, from corrupt preachers, to lavish lifestyles, to claims of miracle healings, to cult-ish followings, and New Age/New Thought concepts. This... is the dark world of Megachurches.

Over the course of many months, we've gotten to know one of the most interesting communities on the internet - one focussed on large-scale global corruption, an opportunity for immense wealth, and the importance of one man...

While some of its members believe they could change the world, critics view them as a cult, damaging not only their own lives but those of their families and loved ones. 

At the centre of it all? One unremarkable retail store. 

In our most ambitious project yet, I've spoken to participants, critics, and experts in an attempt to answer one question: what is going on with GameStop?"

YouTube currently has a problem with scammer bot comments appearing on countless amounts of channels, especially those in the investing and finance niche. 

And unfortunately, we've been the target of these scammers too. So, I decided to do some investigating and confront my scammers/imposters face-to-face.

Investing in the stock market is perhaps one of the easiest investments someone could begin making. 

As opposed to something like real estate, shares are far more liquid and don't require a lot of capital to begin investing in them. But that begs a few questions: what exactly are stocks? How does one begin investing in stocks? And how much money can you truly expect to make from the stock market? 

In this video, we take a look at what the stock market really is, how it works, and some of the common investment advice out there (DISCLAIMER: this is not financial advice - but more of a look at what is commonly taught in personal finance!). 

We'll cover why somebody would decide to sell shares in their company in the first place, what an IPO is, how stock exchanges work, what an order for a share looks like,  as well as some of the different order types that exist. We'll also cover the difference between long-term investing, and short-term investing, what indexes are, as well as how to invest in them through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Index Funds. 

There's also an important warning in the final chapter of this video where we take a look at how the market has been doing overall, and why we're seeing so many people make insane claims about the returns one can expect from the stock market, and whether or not this is typical.

Bitcoin first began when a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” began to circulate on a cryptography mailing list. 

The white paper was signed by an individual going by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. And to this date, Nakamoto’s identity has still not been entirely confirmed. 

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto “mined” the very first block on the Bitcoin blockchain and set into motion a series of events that would lead to the cryptocurrency’s current fame and status. 

But I know what you might be thinking:

What even is Bitcoin? What is blockchain? What is “mining”? What is a cryptocurrency? Why was Bitcoin even created? Does Bitcoin even have any value? And how could this “Bitcoin” be worth tens of thousands of dollars? Is it all just a massive scam? 

In the first part of the series, we covered how Bitcoin ""works"" and what blockchain technology is, as well as looking at an overview of Bitcoin's history. In this second part, however, we will take a look at the problems and underlying issues Bitcoin faces, as well as addressing the Tether conspiracy that could prove to be one of the biggest hits to Bitcoin's value in time.

What even is Bitcoin? What is blockchain? What is “mining”? What is a cryptocurrency? Why was Bitcoin even created? Does Bitcoin even have any value? And how could this “Bitcoin” be worth tens of thousands of dollars? Is it all just a massive scam? 

The debate surrounding Bitcoin is vast, and there’s no shortage of opinions on the subject. In this series we’ll attempt to dissect the history and motivations behind the cryptocurrency’s creation, as well as the big debate on the topic.

We’ll try to answer the question of whether Bitcoin truly is worth something, or whether the investments that have been put into Bitcoin are nothing but pure speculation.

In this first part we will also dive into the technicalities of what “blockchain technology” actually is, how it works, and why it’s so important.  

If you’ve heard of an “NFT” then this will also be very important in understanding they are as well. NFT’s are also operating on “blockchain” technology.

I would also recommend watching 3brown1blue’s video on the subject: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

This series isn’t going to focus too much on the investment side of Bitcoin – whilst that still plays a role in the story, we’re more focused on the motivations and the debate on the topic. 

However, I do believe that by understanding WHAT you are investing in, you shape yourself up for a much better financial decision than just blindly following FOMO and potentially risking your hard-earned money.

Rhonda Byrne's Film, ""The Secret"" popularised the ""Law of Attraction"" greatly, and has allowed this philosophy/belief to permeate in the mainstream for a very long time. 

But the history that lies behind ""The Secret"" is one that has its roots all the way back to the 1800s, where the New Thought Movement began taking strides, as well as other New Age beliefs. 

In this video, we take a dive into that history, and the sinister industry that his been built up around it. We'll take a look at some of the most influential figures in New Thought throughout the past, to present day. Figures like Napoleon Hill (author of ""Think and Grow Rich"", and ""The Law of Success""), Esther/Abraham Hicks (Author of ""The Law of Attraction"" and various other works), Bob Proctor, Rhonda Byrne, and others. 

We will also identify just how  New Age Spirituality has allowed itself to become a perfect grift, for gurus with questionable intentions to enter the space and take advantage of those in a more vulnerable and desperate situation. Those who are in desperate need of wealth, those who are in desperate need for relationships, health, happiness, etc etc. 

New Age/New Thought exists in many areas of the self-help industry too, and although hard to initially spot, once someone familiarises themselves with the teachings of New Thought and the overall philosophy it isn't hard to begin seeing the patterns. 

We will also explore the connections between New Age gurus and Multi Level Marketing companies. A connection that seems very prevalent within many of the big figures in this industry.

The Law of Attraction has been around for quite a while now, with roots that stem back into the 1800s, along with the rise of New Age Spirituality. 

But with Rhonda Byrne’s film, “The Secret” that was promoted extensively by Oprah Winfrey, the Law of Attraction has reached whole new heights of popularity. This in addition to the continuous popularity and sales of Napoleon Hill’s “Think and Grow Rich”, have created a large following of believers in the Law of Attraction and the idea that our thoughts and feelings are able to quite literally change the reality we are living in.  

Which begs the question… does the law of attraction work? Can I truly manifest the life I want? 

In the first part of this two-part series I’ll be taking a look into the actual philosophy behind the Law of Attraction, the supposed “science” behind this belief, and potential explanations for why it can sometimes seem like our thoughts and feelings are able to change our reality. 

In the second part of this two-part series, I’ll be taking a look at the New Age Spirituality industry, the gurus, and where the money flows. Because make no mistake: this is no small business. Individuals like Rhonda Byrne, Esther Hicks, Napoleon Hill, have made millions from promoting this ideology. But how trustworthy are these people, and is there a darker truth behind these seemingly innocent, “optimistic” individuals?

The Rat Race seems to be conflated with working a 9-5 job. It’s often used to guilt those who have a disliking towards their jobs into purchasing a course, program, or something of that nature. 

A real rat race isn’t about working a 9-5 job, it’s about living on a financial edge. Such that your greater life goals and ambitions are placed in the background as you continue chasing the next paycheck, or material possession. 

Our relationship seems with money is often as follows: it enters our life, and it leaves. Sometimes this is expressed as your income and expenses, but I think a better way of framing this is your production vs your consumption. 

For most of us, we have an issue with consumption. And when fixing this, it may be best to first draw an awareness to yourself as a consumer. Using a budget and tracking your expense is the best way of starting. A common strategy in personal finance is building an “emergency fund”, a fund that holds 3 – 6 months’ worth of expenses – enough so that if an emergency were to ever occur, you wouldn’t have a problem financially supporting yourself through such an occasion. 

Production is then about increasing the amount of value you can bring to a society. In my video the Untold Truth About Money I mentioned that people are paid in proportion to their perceived value in the marketplace, and one of the best ways of increasing your perceived value is by solving a problem in the market, then selling this solution through a business at scale. This is the entrepreneurial route. And whilst most of us will be able to produce value into the market by selling our labour in the form of a 9-5 job, this doesn’t mean our ability to produce stops there. 

YouTube channels like Graham Stephan, or Dave Ramsey are great for learning about personal finance, and reducing your expenses. But these people don’t rely on cutting coupons/living frugally to be making millions. They are utilising a means of production at mass scale. Graham Stephan uses YouTube as a vehicle to produce finance videos at mass scale. 

Attempt to identify ways in which you can produce value to the market. For example, I utilised my skills in acting, storytelling, video editing, and presenting, to create videos like the one on my channel. I saw YouTube as a vehicle to be able to produce value to the market at scale.

These companies follow a Multi-Level Marketing model, that means they often do not sell their products/services via retailers, but through a workforce of people sometimes called their “distributors”. This strategy is also often labelled as Network Marketing. 

Examples of these companies are: Herbalife, Amway, ACN, Younique, LuLaRoe, Arbonne, Beachbody, doTerra, Mary Kay, Nu Skin, etc. 

Although it seems ordinary on the surface, many of these companies have received a great amount of backlash, with entire communities built to oppose these companies (often labelled as the anti-mlm community). 

The question here is: why the backlash? 

In this video we dive into the industry and the reasoning behind the backlash, as well as the shady practices some MLM companies use in order to keep their distributors inside the company. 

Some of these practices include the selling of a “dream” and promises of high returns, wealth, residual income, or “financial freedom” if they join, whilst simultaneously promoting many self-help concepts. 

We also take a look at what exactly a Pyramid Scheme is, how to spot one, and whether the accusations against network marketing companies are deserved. 

The pursuit of wealth and financial freedom can often be consuming – the question is who out there is choosing to exploit these desires…

Tyler1 is known today as a popular streamer on the Twitch platform, and a player of the popular online video game League of Legends (created by the company Riot Games). 

Others may know him from the various ""rage compilation"" and ""meme compilation"" videos of him spread out across YouTube and other platforms that have garnered millions of views. 

But before Tyler1's brand became as established as it is today, and before Tyler1 was known for his entertainment, he was initially classed as ""the most toxic League of Legends player in North America"". People only recognised Tyler for his toxic behaviour in the League of Legends community.

Tyler1's story was something quite surreal to have witnessed, especially for those who had first seen his rise to fame initially through Disco Heat's video on Tyler1.

Disco Heat's video had propelled Tyler1's audience into the thousands. It also highlighted his toxic behaviour in the game, and spawned copycats that would mimic Tyler1's attitude and behaviour whilst playing League of Legends.  

What ensued afterwards was a rare ""indefinite ban"" punishment by Riot Games, and a battle between Tyler1 as a brand and Riot Games as a company. 

This brought Tyler1's brand to a standstill and an all important realisation: that if Tyler1 was to maintain his audience and streaming career, he would have to be known for something other than his toxic behaviour. He would have to create a ""redemption arc"" for his brand, and eclipse the negative associations of his current brand. 

What followed was a series of entertaining and special events throughout Tyler1's streaming career that allowed him to craft memorable moments that would define his brand amongst the streaming community of Twitch. 

Tyler1’s story and journey as a brand displayed how a personal brand is built on a persons’ experience of you. Change their experience and you change the brand. It isn’t about the followers, nor is it about exposure. Your brand is built from the moment you interact with someone else.

YOUR DATA 
Your name, your age, your height, your weight, where you live, where you work, your family, your friends, your likes, your dislikes, your phone number, your email, your health conditions, your buying habits, your credit score, your political beliefs, your religious beliefs, who you text… 

These are all examples of ‘data points’. And these pieces of data are very valuable things.

WHERE IS PERSONAL DATA SOURCED?
In order to source this information, begin by scraping data from public records. Things like: social media pages, property records, court records, birth certificates, voter registration information, bankruptcy records. 

Then go ahead and purchase data from OTHER companies. That’s right: other companies that have your data can make an extra stream of revenue for themselves by selling the information they have on their customers. 

Create “free” websites and services, that collect data from your users. Put ‘trackers’ on these websites/services that detect a user’s location, their contact list, their photos, etc. 

CREATING PROFILES FROM OUR DATA
Finally, once we’ve gathered all this data, we can begin to create ‘profiles’ of individuals. This can detail an individual’s behaviour/personality when it comes to their buying habits, their likes/dislikes, their political affiliations, their health concerns, etc. 

Once we have created these profiles… it’s time to sell! 

SELLING THE DATA
You can sell this information to… pretty much whoever wants it. 

The most common customers that data brokers have at the moment are marketing companies. If a gym had a list of individuals who were interested in getting fit, that would be a very valuable audience for them to target with their advertisements. 

But you can also sell this data to health insurance companies, banks, ‘people search’ websites, governments, and other data brokers. 

THE DILEMMA
Although it sounds quite sinister, this industry does pose a dilemma: if a many of the free websites and apps that you use require your data in order to stay profitable – is it really such a problem? If it’s just being used for marketing purposes, is there a big consequence to that? 

This is a current argument that is going on in the industry at the moment, and it’s one that I have struggled with getting to grips with as well. One thing that I do believe strongly is that the way in which your data is managed should be regulated fare more than it currently is.

This is one of those rare startup stories that can be quite motivational to some entrepreneurs out there. But most importantly, there is one huge lesson that can be taken away from the insane story of Instagram:

KEVIN SYSTROM.
Kevin Systrom (one of the founders who created Instagram) was born on the 30th December 1983. As a child he worked at a vinyl record store, and was a big fan of the game Doom II (he was also an avid book reader, and still is to this day!). From Doom 2, Kevin found a love for computer programming. 

During his time at Stanford, he briefly met with Mike Krieger where they spoke about his experience on the Mayfield Fellows Program. Whilst on the program Kevin had worked at a tech company called Odeo, a company that later went on to become Twitter. You can find a lot of this information scattered throughout Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger interviews.

A MEETING WITH MIKE KRIEGER.
After finishing college and working for a few years at several companies, Kevin has a meeting with Mike Krieger (who was also in the area) at a café. In that café they discuss the ideas for creating their first ever app. But it wasn’t Instagram…

BURBN.
Burbn was a check-in app, much like Foursquare. This was the original idea that Kevin and Mike came up with before creating Instagram. 
Burbn received a large sum of capital from investors like Steve Anderson, and the venture capitalist company called Andreessen Horowitz. In total Kevin Systrom and Mike Kreiger had raised half a million dollars towards Burbn. But no matter how much investors throw at your company, it won’t change the fact that the market may still not like your product or service.
The sad truth was that Burbn was not getting much attraction. Mike and Kevin recognised this and realised they needed to change ideas.

THE PIVOT.
The Lean Startup by Eric Reiss popularised the term ‘pivoting’ for startups, and this is exactly what Mike & Kevin did with Burbn. They realised that most of their customers were interested in the photo sharing aspects of their app, and had little to no interest in the check in features. So they stripped away all of that stuff, and created an app that was all about photo sharing – some may have called this their minimum viable product (another popularised startup term from Eric Reiss’ The Lean Startup).

INSTAGRAM.
Kevin Systrom also went on a vacation around this time with his (now) wife Nicole Systrom. On that vacation Nicole told him that she would likely not use the app because she didn’t think she could take good enough photos. Kevin saw that she was trying to compare her own photo-taking abilities to her friends who would use filters on their photos. Kevin identified a problem immediately, and created the first ever filter on Instagram the X Pro II. 
You can still find the first ever photo on Instagram to this day on Kevin Systrom’s official Instagram account. 

SELLING FOR ONE BILLION.
Instagram was sold to Facebook for 1 billion dollars. The company is now valued at around 100 billion, and it can be argued that Kevin and Mike’s decision to sell Instagram was a clever one at the end of the day, allowing their company to grow at the hands of Mark Zuckerberg.

RULES OF A RECESSION.
A country is often described to be in a 'recession' when its GDP has been declining for 6 months in a row (although sometimes this definition varies depending on who you ask). 
With that being said, there are some important rules to keep in mind if you want to profit from a recession. The first rule being: nobody can time the market. No matter what, nobody knows WHEN is the next recession. 

But once a recession does hit, it’s important to not panic and start selling all your assets, because one thing is for sure: the market will always bounce back. But since the market is always shrinking and expanding, that also means that the market will always eventually crash. 

HOW TO PREPARE FOR A RECESSION…
Preparing for a recession is perhaps the most important part of this whole game. It’s very important that you start to save up money, build capital, avoid debt, and build a healthy credit score. You want to make sure that you have all the resources ready to make the most from that economic collapse. There’s nothing worse than seeing so many opportunities in-front of you, but no ways to take advantage of them.

WHAT HAPPENS DURING A MARKET CRASH?
When an economies market crashes (for whatever reason) one can expect an increase in unemployment levels, business bankruptcy, and three very important things to rise: death, divorce, defaults. 

HOW TO INVEST DURING A RECESSION?
When the market crashes, people become desperate to sell their assets like shares, and real estate. And the more motivated someone is to sell something, the likelier they are to sell it for cheaper. 

That’s where you come in. 

If you’ve prepared for the recession properly, then you should have a good amount of capital saved up and ready to invest back into the economy. Why invest back into the economy? Remember: the market will always bounce back. And everything is on a discount during a recession. That means you get to buy assets for way below market value, and then sell those very assets once the market bounces right back up – which it always will.

21,The Rise of Fake Gurus: The Dark Truth Behind Making MILLIONS from Online Courses.,0:21:37,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Gpr7PEnbs,2020-02-03,"You've seen them everywhere. 

On the 3rd of September 2015, Tai Lopez released his infamous ‘Here in My Garage’ Youtube Ad.

This single Ad created a wave of what some have described as fake gurus, selling you their courses and mastermind programs like no tomorrow with promises of ‘financial freedom’, ‘a laptop lifestyle’, and the possibility to ‘travel around the world’. Sounds great, right? 

In this video I break down the business model of how to make millions from online courses using the methods that these fake gurus use, and expose the dark truth behind this rapidly growing industry.

DISCLAIMER: Look, I think online courses are brilliant. They helped me edit this video, learn about marketing, personal finance etc. But none of these courses promised me ‘financial freedom’, or a ‘laptop lifestyle'. These courses had set a clear expectation, and I received a clear result.

Step 1 – Pick Your Niche
This is where you get to choose the topic of your choice. Preferably it’s a fad, and something that could be promoted under the categories of wealth, or health, or anything that allows you to target people’s dreams.

Here are some of the most common niches used by a few well-known gurus…
Kevin David - Amazon FBA, Dropshipping.
Dan Lok – Sales.
John Crestani – Affiliate Marketing.
Iman Gadzhi – Digital Marketing Agency (otherwise called an SMMA – a term popularised by Tai Lopez). 
Sam Ovens – Consulting. 
Samuel Leeds – Real Estate Investing. 

Step 2 – Create Your Course
Preferably you have some experience in your niche. In most cases the ideal route is to pick a niche, start a business in your niche and get a little success, then create your own online course – because after all, that’s where the real money is made. 

If you don’t have any expertise, you can always hire an outside expert to give you a helping hand.

You see, the course isn’t what matters the most here, what matters the most is your online marketing for the course.

Step 3 – Market Your Course
This is the most important part of this business model. Without marketing your online course properly, you won’t be able to make a lot of money from it.

Start by running some advertisements on Youtube, Instagram, Facebook etc, and begin by selling them a dream. Tell your audience that you were also broke and in debt, but after starting [insert niche here] you began making six figures, millions, travelling around the world, became financially free, have a laptop lifestyle, etc… 

Tell them to join your free training – where your main goal isn’t to teach them anything, but to get them to ask more questions. Remind them of their dreams, remind them of your backstory, and finally go in for the hard sell where you create scarcity and a sense of urgency in order to get them to buy your ridiculously priced course RIGHT NOW.

Step 4 – Profit.
With the right marketing, you should now be seeing some of that sweet, sweet profit fly in from your online courses. 

But why stop there? The real way to make millions from online courses is to create an entire ladder of products. You want to upsell your ‘students’ as much as possible. Get your ‘students’ hooked on your products.

You never tell them the truth: the reason you’re so rich, is because of all the products you’ve sold them. NOT because of your dropshipping or Amazon FBA business. 

BACKLASH AGAINST FAKE GURUS
Thankfully, there has been a rise in backlash against these so-called fake gurus. Thanks to channels like Coffeezilla (otherwise known as Coffee Break), Mike Winnet, and Spencer Cornelia to name a few.

22,Is University Worth it Anymore?,0:24:44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg6CGNoynDI,2020-01-27,"Is university worth it, or is university a scam? 
How valuable is a degree, and what degree should I choose? 

These are very important questions you must ask yourself when deciding whether or not you should go to university. 

I’ve spoken to so many people about this topic and I break it all down in this video.

NOTE: this video is primarily for those in England, but some information I discuss applies to the US as well.

ARE STUDENT LOANS WORTH IT?
I don’t think student debt should be a major concern – at least not if you are in England. Here’s how student loans work in England: you begin by choosing your repayment plan. Plans 1 & 2 will only have you paying 9% of your income that goes above the threshold (£25.72k) every month. The threshold is the amount of money you are expected to earn a year before you start paying back student loans. On an income of £40k you will only be repaying £1,285 a year. It’s not a lot, and it all gets written off after 30 years anyway. So what’s my biggest concern with going to university…? 

WHAT DEGREE SHOULD I DO?
Choosing your degree is the most important factor in this debate. There are so many people that will choose a degree because of parental pressure, societal pressure, or pressure from their friends. They will choose a degree because it looked “fun”, or it seemed “interesting”, but a lot of people do not ask themselves: what career do I want to get into? And even more importantly: do I need this degree to get into a career?

SHOULD YOU TAKE A GAP YEAR?
One of my biggest solutions to not knowing whether or not you should go to university, and what degree you should pick is taking a gap year. I know it works slightly different in the US, but in England you are given the choice to take a year off after sixth form (otherwise known as a “gap year”). Take it.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IN A GAP YEAR?
A few of my recommendations are reading, getting a job, going to networking events, and travelling. Generally, you want to experiment and try different things. It’s important to see what you enjoy and are more inclined towards, which can aid you in making a decision on what career you want to get into. Once you know what career you would like to go down, check to see if you need a degree to start working in that field. If you don’t, then it may be that going to university is not needed for you to get a job.

WHAT IS THE VALUE OF A DEGREE?
Grade inflation is a big problem that universities are tying to tackle. More than half of university students are leaving with a first, or a 2:1. To add to that, the student cap that once prevented universities from letting in as many students as they liked has now been removed. Removing the student cap has increased competition between universities, and now it’s become a major competition to get as many students in as possible. 
This all becomes problematic when you look at how employable a degree makes you. The more graduates with top classifications there are, the less an employer can differentiate between who is truly the best, and who is not. My personal opinion is that a degree can get you a foot in the door for a job, but that is as far as it goes. The rest is up to how you perform in the interview.
I would even go as far as to say that some employers (depending on the career) prefer non-graduates, so that they are coming into the company with a ‘clean slate’ and can be moulded through the company and not already enter the job with pre—conceived ideas and notions on how that company may or may not function.
